				<em>Yoga is in fashion, that’s a fact. It has reached the mainstream and now, it has certainly changed a lot since its origins. But what is yoga really about and how is it to teach it? That’s what we tried to find out in this interview with Alexandra van Oosterum, a yoga teacher for almost 35 years and a founder of <a href="https://www.soloyoga.com/" target="_blank">Soloyoga</a>.</em>
			</p>
			
			<p><img class="w-full h-2 mx-auto" src="/jobcasts/user/themes/jobcasts/images/line.png" alt="Separator"></p>
			
			<p><strong>Where and when did you start teaching yoga?</strong></p>
<p>When I started teaching, I was in Italy. But I started doing yoga when I was 20 and now, I’m 74. So when I started, I never thought I was going to teach yoga. But when I got back in Milan from Indonesia where I had a beautiful yoga teacher — Ann Freeman — , not finding anyone near that was as good as she was, I started to follow a teacher training course. I wasn’t thinking of teaching, but then a friend of mine said, ‘Why don’t you teach?’. And so I started! This was back in ‘86.</p>
<p><strong>How would you sum up your job?</strong></p>
<p>Well you know, teaching yoga is really a way of life. It doesn’t start in class and it doesn’t finish in class. You get a kind of <em>feeling</em> with your students. People send me emails, they phone me and whatever, because you have to have feeling with people. When you teach a class, you mostly teach <abbr title="body postures"><em>asana</em></abbr>, but yoga isn’t only <em>asana</em>. There’s a lot of philosophy, there’s a lot of texts, there’s a lot of books, there is meditation — and so it’s really quite a lot of things you do, even when you’re not in class.</p>
<p><strong>How come you started doing yoga and how did you end up teaching it?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t ever thinking of teaching yoga. I started doing yoga because with the job of my husband, we went a lot abroad. We went to Nigeria, we went to Indonesia, we went to Tehran... In all those places, I didn’t have anywhere to go and practice, so a friend of mine in Holland who was a yoga teacher, gave me a beautiful book and I took this book with me wherever I went. I taught myself yoga until I came to Jakarta in Indonesia, and met Ann Freeman. She was a very good yoga teacher — in the line of <abbr title="important yoga teacher">Vishnudevananda</abbr> — , and so I studied with her. That really got me on the right track. From then on, I never left yoga again.</p>
<p><strong>What was your idea and expectations about this job before you started it?</strong></p>
<p>When I started doing yoga, I was pregnant so I wasn’t thinking of getting a job, I was thinking of being healthy. As a job, I taught Latin in the Dutch school in Jakarta and I was doing translations, but I was never thinking of teaching yoga. I started teaching yoga because some friends of mine asked me to. And then, I felt it was very nice to teach yoga.
It just happened. You see, when you have expectations, you might get deluded you know. Sometimes you think, <em>This is going to be beautiful</em>, and then it’s awful. When you don’t think about it, then whatever happens is okay.</p>
<p><img alt="Getting ready for the yoga class." src="/jobcasts/user/pages/03.blog/74-years-and-counting-a-lifetime-of-teaching-yoga/yoga-teacher-training-course.jpg" /><figcaption class="text-base text-gray-600">Getting ready for the yoga class.</figcaption></p>
<p><strong>Not building expectations — do you think this is part of the philosophy behind yoga?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think so. I think that when you start out in yoga, most people — let’s say, people that do yoga with me, my students — , they think they will get slimmer, they think they will be happier, more serene, etc. Whatever they think and want, never happens. But whatever happens is so much more than what they wanted when they started out, that in the end they get hooked.
Today, you see a lot of marketing in yoga. You see a lot of beautiful photographs and you see a lot of promises — you will be happy, you will be serene, you will manage your troubles, your mindfulness, and all these kinds of things. But people forget that they have to do it themselves. So what do you do as a teacher? You give them the tricks to do it themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You see, when you have expectations, you might get deluded you know. [...] When you don’t think about it, then whatever happens is okay.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What would be your typical day at work?</strong></p>
<p>Well when I started out, I was always very nervous. I would make a list of everything we were going to do during class and then when I did the class, it never worked out. So nowadays, I go to class 10 minutes earlier and I look at the people when they come into class. I see their faces, I see their bodies, and I see the way they carry their chest. And then, I decide what kind of class I’m going to teach today. And then, sometimes they say to me, ‘That was a very nice class, it just looked like it was meant for me’. </p>
<p><strong>How do you gain this look, this observational skill of seeing people and understanding what their bodies and minds might be needing?</strong></p>
<p>This happens once you get enough experience. You have to look at people, but when you look at people you have to see them. I can see them also when I’m in a supermarket, when I walk around. Let’s say I’m in an airport and I see a person walking around. I think, <em>Oh they should do this asana, they should breathe that way, …</em>, and then I really have to stop myself from not interfering.
But you get this with experience. I started teaching in ‘86 — now we are in 2020. The more people you see, the more classes you teach... In the beginning I taught something like four or five classes a day. Now, I teach much less but I have a teacher training course.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the teacher training course you organize? And for someone that is thinking of taking such a course, how can they distinguish a good teaching course from just good marketing?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a very interesting question but also a very difficult one, because not every teacher is the right teacher for every person. But if you consider you want to become a yoga teacher, you should shop around a bit. Everything that is too short is not good, because we expect people to read classical texts and books — it really takes some time. So, if you have a course that is about four weekends, you’ll have no time to get to the material. You have to absorb what you read, you have to study it, you have to think about it.
So, our teacher training course takes three years. It’s around 450 hours. And of course we want people to study at home and we want them to read the books we want them to read, and so on. So, it’s a long time. Some people start, they don’t want to teach and at the end of the course, they teach. Some people start, they really want to teach and after a year, they say, ‘Goodbye, this is not for me’.</p>
<p><img alt="Yoga is not only asana. Theory is fundamental in Alexandra's course." src="/jobcasts/user/pages/03.blog/74-years-and-counting-a-lifetime-of-teaching-yoga/yoga-books.jpg" /><figcaption class="text-base text-gray-600">Yoga is not only <em>asana</em>. Theory is fundamental in Alexandra's course.</figcaption> </p>
<p><strong>In your experience, why is it that people change their minds while doing the course? Do you think it’s correlated with the expectations that people come to the course with?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that’s one point. People come to the course and they think it’s fashionable, it’s very interesting... Yoga is now the <em>in</em> thing! But of course, if you teach yoga, you have to have that eye and look at people and understand them. See what the body tells you, see what a face tells you, see what the kind of voice you hear tells you — all these things. You have to be interested in people, so if you really don’t like people, this is not your job.</p>
<p><strong>Our ability to focus is changing and it’s becoming harder and harder to just do one thing at the time. Do you think this is affecting our way to be with people and actually see them?</strong></p>
<p>What happens is that nowadays, we have this cult of individuality. The ego of the person. So they’re interested very much in themselves, they are not so much interested in the others. If you’re not interested in other people, then this is not your job. You have to think that other people are interesting and that they can teach you something. Because we are teaching but in the meantime, we learn such a lot from our students. You would never get anywhere if you don’t have the students that teach you. Because when they do something, you look at it and say, ‘Well how did they manage to do that?’. And then you have to kind of think about it and start to work on it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have to be interested in people, so if you really don’t like people, this is not your job.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How important is your job in your life?</strong></p>
<p>This kind of job — which I really wouldn’t call a job you know, because I <em>happened</em> to start doing it, and then I <em>happened</em> to continue, and then I <em>happened</em> to start a teacher training course... [These things happened] always because people asked me to [and not because of any other reason] — because I’m really very lazy.
So they asked me and I started out. And when I started out with the teacher training course, I decided <em>how to do it</em> because I took courses myself. It’s very important in your life to know what you don’t like. When you know what you don’t like, then you can kind of fit in what you do like. And in this kind of job, there are so many books to read, you study all your life. Even if I wouldn’t be teaching, I would still be in yoga. So, for me it’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>What helped you understand what you don’t like?</strong></p>
<p>I always say to the students — especially in the training courses — to try and take as many classes as you can with as many different teachers, because then you can see what works for you and what doesn’t work for you. And some things are just horrible, I mean. I saw a person who jumped on the knees of another person that was sitting in the <abbr title="yoga posture"></abbr><em>lotus posture</em>. The guy, he jumped on the knees [of the other person], so you kind of heard ‘crack’! Like a barbecued chicken. So, then it’s very easy to know you don’t like that.
You just try, and try and try. And when you go, you should never have an expectation. You just try and then you say, ‘This works for me’. Now, if it works for you, it might work for other people. But it doesn’t mean that if it does not work for you, it does <em>not</em> work for another person. Every person is different and this is why you have to look at them. No one is the same. Every mind, every body, every breath is different. </p>
<p><strong>Do you think that also yoga is suffering from the ‘industrialization’ mindset, where everything is applied equally to everyone, like in a production chain?</strong></p>
<p>You have two ways of doing it. You can teach yoga and what I would call ‘yoga fit’. Nothing against it. Yoga fit is okay. But if you do yoga fit, you say, ‘I do yoga fit’, you don’t say ‘I teach classical, traditional yoga’. Because once you teach classical, traditional yoga, you have to keep in mind there is a philosophy — and you cannot ignore the philosophy. You cannot ignore anatomy either. People are made a certain way, so I cannot expect people to do things that their body will never allow them to do. You have to keep in mind these things.
So, if you try to sell yoga as a normal product — like say, I sell yoga like a fridge, or I sell yoga like a car — , then I have the same strategy for everybody. And this is not the way it’s going to work. I think yoga — especially in teacher training courses — shouldn’t have more than 10 or 15 students. So, a good teacher doesn’t mean he or she has 102 people laying on the floor. A good teacher means having an eye for 10 people and raise them. It is not quantity, it is quality. You say, ‘My book sold so many copies’ — but did people read it? So, it’s not so important the quantity, it’s important that you get to the right people. Because if you train a teacher, you have a responsibility. This teacher is going to teach other people and other people might have all kinds of ailments and all things that happened to them — and so they have to be good teachers and be aware of this.</p>

<p><strong>Do you enjoy having this responsibility, or do you sometimes feel it’s too much?</strong></p>
<p>What happens is that in yoga, we are responsible even for our birth. You don’t happen to be born, you were born because there was a reason for it. So, we have this sense of responsibility. Nowadays, discipline and responsibility are not very happy words — people don’t like it. But on the other hand, you are responsible for what your students are going to teach. Now, what happens is that once you give them a diploma — a piece of paper — , that’s when the difficulty starts. Because then they have to go out on their own — and this is true, and this is right, and this should be so. So then, I try to follow up. We try to meet again, to have occasions where we meet again and we talk it over. Sometimes, I see horrible things on the internet and I say, ‘Oh my goodness, that’s a student of mine’. But you cannot help everybody and you cannot make everybody happy. And I don’t want to sound terribly arrogant, but my problem is I don’t want people to get hurt. And people can damage themselves and people can get hurt also in yoga. </p>
<p><strong>How do you prevent giving the diploma to someone that is not ready yet?</strong> </p>
<p>Well, we have 3 years time, so you see the person grow into it. Sometimes, unfortunately I say to someone, ‘You know, maybe this is not the right course for you’. On the other hand, you see people that really blossom up like a flower. They get into it and they become beautiful teachers. We have some teachers that I really say, ‘Uau! I’m so happy!’. This week we have lockdown and everything, and so I’ve looked at all the theses that people wrote — these 360 papers I have here — , and some of them are really beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>So the thesis is part of the course. Why do you think it’s important to have a thesis in a yoga teacher training course?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is very simple. When I was translating <abbr title="yoga monk">Swamiji Yogaswarupananda</abbr> at <abbr title="one of the first yoga teachers in Italy">Carlo Patrian’s</abbr> teacher training course in Milan years ago, Swamiji said something about someone — I think it was about <abbr title="important yoga teacher and a key figure in the introduction of yoga in the Western world">Vivekananda</abbr> — , and people looked at him and didn’t know who Vivekananda was. He said, ‘How come they do not understand, I’m talking about Vivekananda and nobody knows who he is’. And I said, ‘Well, they just don’t know’. So what I did was, I said: in the first year, every student has to write a paper about a famous or important traditional yoga teacher. They can choose, and what they do is they choose a teacher — let’s say they choose Vivekananda as I was saying before — , they start studying books, reading about his life, and then they illustrate the thesis to the others. So, every single student knows about this teacher because someone made a thesis about him/her. If you have 15 students, you have 15 teachers. And then everybody knows, because of course the students give their thesis to everybody else in the course.</p>

<p><strong>Could you tell us briefly about your teacher training course? What does it consist of?</strong></p>
<p>In the first year we do mostly anatomy — anatomy applied to <em>asana</em>, to postures — and we do <abbr title="energy focal points of the body"><em>chakra</em></abbr>. In the second year, we start from a medical point of view — how does the whole body work, the nervous system, things like this. We read <em>Hatha Yoga Pradipika</em> — which is a classical text — , and we read <abbr title="important text dealing with what happens to the soul after death"><em>Katha Upanishad</em></abbr>, and they have to read it and explain it. Of course in the meantime they teach each other, so they are guided for teaching. They prepare lessons and they teach each other. And of course, they present a thesis. In the second year, we start with <abbr title="science of life, the traditional Indian medical system"><em>ayurveda</em></abbr>, <abbr title="prayers to be chanted to create an energy flow"><em>mantra</em></abbr>, and the more traditional things. And you know, they are quite busy, they have a lot of homework. And then, of course they have to show how they teach. And I show them how to correct and how to not correct, when to correct and when to not correct — because sometimes it’s much better to let it go.</p>
<p><strong>When you feel a bit lost or not knowing what you want to be doing, what kind of questions do you put to yourself that help you understand what to do?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is an interesting question, because everybody — and of course, me too — has a moment when you say, ‘Is it worth it? What I’m doing, is it right? Does it make sense?’. But you know, that’s why it’s important to have students, because it’s the students that ask you to continue. Now, I’m of course preparing a new arrangement: I have Chiara Cornacchia for anatomy, I have Giovanna Scipioni for philosophy and so on — because I know I’m 74. So at 74, this year, I started a new teacher training course that will take another 3 years, maybe 4 (because we tend to have longer courses now). So of course you also need a follow-up. But I think as long as I feel I want to do it, I’ll just do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[...] teaching yoga is not so much of a job as a passion. You do it because you believe in it and you do it also — and this sounds very arrogant, I know — because yoga is meant to help people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What would you appreciate people would do to make your job easier?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, well here we have a point: I am not a native Italian. So, what happens is that in Italy, we have a bureaucracy which is terrifying! The rules and regulations are so unclear that it is really, very, very difficult to say how I’m going to continue and stay legally and fiscally safe. It’s very difficult to be a yoga teacher because it’s very difficult to know: do I need a <abbr title="Italian VAT registration number"><em>partita IVA</em></abbr>, do I do it this way, do I do it that way… It’s very difficult. The bureaucracy is really terrifying. And a lot of money goes to consultants, which in the end makes your course more expensive. There are lots of people with little money but great talent and I believe they should have an opportunity too.</p>
<p><strong>So it would help you to have a clearer, simpler bureaucracy.</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But it will never happen in Italy. You know, with what’s happening now with Covid, nobody knows what one has to do and what one does not have to do — the whole time it’s like this. Of course we have certain rules in yoga teaching, like in teaching sports. People need a <abbr title="medical certificate"><em>certificato medico</em></abbr> and that’s okay.
And of course, as we have ethical rules, we want to pay taxes. Now, it would be so nice if we want to pay taxes, that you would make it easy for us to do so, and not so terribly complicated that you need an accountant, and you need a tax advisor, and you need a consultant, and ...[<em>sighs</em>]. Whatever! That is one of those things that sometimes you say, ‘I’ll just stop! I hate this!’. In the second year of our training course, we have an accountant that comes in our class and explains everything, and then the students look at us and they say, ‘Shall we continue with the third year or shall we stop here?’.
But I think in Italy this might be difficult for everybody on the free market. Everybody that is on the free market has this kind of bureaucratic terrifying situation. </p>
<p><strong>You’ve set up your own school of yoga — <a href="https://www.soloyoga.com/" target="_blank">Soloyoga</a>. How was the process of setting it up?</strong></p>
<p>Well, when I did my teacher training course with Carlo Patrian in Italy, it was in ‘86. Then in 2002, I went to Seattle, to <abbr title="Alexandra’s teacher in Seattle">Bob Smith</abbr>, and I decided to do another training course with him at the island of Bali /Indonesia. When I came back, people said to me, ‘Well now you did the teacher training courses, so why don’t you start a course on your own, your own teacher training course?’. So we started out with only six people and it was very interesting, because of course it was an experiment for me and it was an experiment for them too. And I’m very grateful that they had all that the patience to be my <abbr title="guinea pigs"><em>cavia</em></abbr>. We just tried it out, and from then on, it just kind of went on automatically. Of course, we had to meet rules and regulations — like constituting an association, and all kinds of things. But the bureaucratic thing is always there, if you want to do it. Because once you have a teacher training course, at the end you give a diploma. The diploma is of your school, but of course it has to be recognized, otherwise sports centers and so on won't hire your students.</p>
<p><strong>How can you keep up with bureaucracy and all its constant changes?</strong></p>
<p>This is a problem, but then you need a consultant. You kind of hand it over, because otherwise you don’t sleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about Covid, how was it to adjust to the pandemic and how did the courses change this year?</strong></p>
<p>Well, just this morning we had a meeting through Google Meet with our students to keep contact. I read <abbr title="famous yoga text"><em>Katha Upanishad</em></abbr> in pieces online, also for my students. I don’t believe in teaching postures online because I cannot go and correct my students. I cannot see them very well and know what they are doing, so I don’t like that, but we try to keep in contact and we hopefully will start [the classes] in presence again.</p>
<p><strong>For people that are thinking of pursuing this area, what kind of advice would you like to give them?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so Swami Yogaswarupananda says you shouldn’t teach yoga as a main job. You should have a job and also teach yoga. Why is he saying this? Because you need your freedom. You cannot please everybody. If you teach yoga, you must be able to lose a student. If you have 20 students that pay the bills — the rent, the light, the heating, and so on — and then suddenly you have 18 and you cannot pay your telephone bill anymore, you have a problem. So you need a job for your urgent needs as a human being to survive, and then, whatever you earn teaching yoga is extra. Because you need to have the freedom to teach the way you think you should teach.
Not everybody is the same. I would never be able to teach yoga fit, because it’s not in me. So, I have the freedom to say, ‘Okay, you don’t like me. Please go to my colleague’. And I’ll also tell you to whom to go. But you have to have the freedom to teach according to your nature, to whatever you believe in.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that this is actually being followed in the world of yoga? Quality above quantity?</strong></p>
<p>I have been very fortunate because I’ve met some really good teachers — some of them are not here anymore — , and they gave me this way of thinking about it. They said teaching yoga is not so much of a job as a passion. You do it because you believe in it and you do it also — and this sounds very arrogant, I know — because yoga is meant to help people. Yoga is meant to be a way to help towards a better life. Happy body, but also happy mind.
So in this case, if you really believe in it, you should, according to my Indian teachers, accept only donations. In the beginning, I taught for free, as I had another income for my basic needs.
Nowadays, if you teach for free, if you don’t ask for money, they think you are not an able teacher. So, many of my colleagues, and myself of course, we have to pay our bills and so on — and I think that’s okay. But then when I see that a course online of 22 hours costs 480 euros, then I think we are not there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that this can be a deterrent for some people that want to teach yoga?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I am very fortunate. Most of the people that enroll in our teacher training course know that it’s not going to be their main job. They already have a job and they started doing yoga maybe 10 years ago. And then, in their normal classes — where they go once or twice a week — , they don’t get the information they want, so they start a teacher training course to get into the philosophy. </p>

<p>“Don’t think of yoga only as gymnastics. Yoga is gymnastics and that’s okay, but there’s so much more to it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the main difficulties in teaching the philosophy of yoga?</strong></p>
<p>Well you know, we don’t have to be missionaries. We don’t have to put into people’s minds things that they don’t want. So what I do in the courses I teach weekly — not the teacher training course — , every now and then, I tell a story. Every now and then, I say, ‘Well why don’t you read this and that book’, or I say, ‘Well, you know let’s do a small meditation and see if you can do it at home’ — this kind of thing. If they get interested, they will ask you for other books, they will ask you for other advice.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to say to someone that is thinking of trying yoga or teaching yoga?</strong></p>
<p>What I would say is: yoga is not only in the West — yoga is coming from India. So try to keep up also a bit with the tradition. Don’t think of yoga only as gymnastics. Yoga is gymnastics and that’s okay, but there’s so much more to it. So, for instance, now in Covid, we cannot go out, so how nice is it to be able to read books? We have so many aspects in yoga that really help and this is what makes it so interesting. We keep on studying our whole life. </p>
