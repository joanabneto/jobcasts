				<em>Most likely in your life, the word ‘autism’ has popped up into some conversation at least once, but it’s such a complex theme, that one might end up feeling very distant from. In this interview, we talked with Inês Neto, the pedagogical director of the <a href="https://www.appda-lisboa.org.pt/" target="_blank">Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism (APPDA)</a> LISBOA, to try and get a better understanding of what her job is about and how her association is trying to change our view on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</em>

			<p><strong>How did you get into this profession? What is your background?</strong></p>
<p><span class="big-letter">I</span>f I think of my teenage years, I honestly never thought of doing this. In school when we made psychological tests to see what the best areas to pursue are professionally, the test results said I should work with drug addicts or people with disabilities, and that wasn’t my goal.
I came home and said: ‘These tests don’t work. This makes absolutely no sense. I’m 14 years old, I want to be a nurse. I respect people that work with these groups, but that’s not what I want’. At the end of highschool, when it came to the point where I had to choose a university, I could apply for six options. On the first five options, I chose to apply for becoming a nurse, but on the sixth, I chose to apply for psychomotor therapist, which was a new course. No one knew exactly what it was, but it seemed interesting. Since I didn’t get into any of the nursing options, I ended up in the sixth option — psychomotor therapist. I didn’t have any expectations to be honest, but during the 4 years of the course I really enjoyed it and the results of the psychological tests started to make sense. When I graduated, I felt really happy with my choice. </p>
<p>The profession that I have right now is not directly linked with my studies. I started as a psychomotor therapist right in 2007, and until 2017 I worked in the field, directly with groups with disabilities and mostly with people with <abbr title="Autism Spectrum Disorder">ASD</abbr>. I went to schools, I gave psychomotor sessions, I worked in swimming pools, I worked with therapy using horses — I worked everywhere.</p>
<p>In 2017, in my association — <abbr title="Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism">APPDA LISBOA</abbr> — there was a job opening for a pedagogical director. I must say that when I sent my CV, I sent it more as a: ‘Let’s take a risk’. There are more than 80 workers in APPDA LISBOA and I can honestly say that no one believed I could get the job. I was almost like a gym teacher. I was working with training gear, at the gym with them, so I wasn’t exactly what you would expect from a director. So, at first sight, I didn't fit the profile. But then I don’t know how, I got the job and it was a shock for everyone, even for myself. I was happy, but it was a completely different setting than what I had studied for. All the experience that I had gathered along the years gave me the needed background to be able to face the challenges of the place I’m now in, but now I do nothing related to what I studied in university.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think your background as a psychomotor therapist helps you with what you’re doing today?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, of course. The experience at college and especially these 10 years working directly with people with ASD from 4 up to 60 years old, allowed me to see what’s important to them and what’s important to meet their families’ expectations. These are two of the most important things to take into account in order to do my job well.</p>
<p><strong>When you saw this job opening, what was your idea of the job itself?</strong></p>
<p>I can honestly say — and I’m not just saying this to look good — that I thought it was an unreachable job. When I started working in APPDA LISBOA in 2007 and got introduced to the then-director, I looked at him like you look at a hero, an example to follow. He was a psychologist and psychologists are often more recognized than my profession. We are the ones that work at the gym, so we might look like a disposable therapist, even though we are not. So, at first I could see that if you had to choose between a psychologist and a psychomotor therapist, you would choose the psychologist. But then, maybe 2 years before I applied, that director retired and the person who replaced him was a colleague of mine. She was younger and more similar to me, so I think that was a decisive step. She was a psychologist too, older than me and with more experience, but I felt it was a step closer to me — to the humans down here — , and so I decided to apply.
But what really drove me to this job was the challenge it posed. I really like to work with teams, and to try and be the person that takes a deep breath and says: ‘Okay, let’s all calm down and think more clearly’. I like to be the head of a team, not being on top of it per say, but mostly trying to gather people, having in mind all that they have to contribute. </p>
<p><img alt="Weaving classes are part of the daily activities at the APPDA LISBOA" src="/jobcasts/user/pages/03.blog/a-pedagogical-director-and-a-peek-into-the-world-of-asd/weaving-classes.jpeg" /><figcaption class="text-base text-gray-600">Weaving classes are part of the daily activities at the APPDA LISBOA.</figcaption></p>
<p><strong>You also play female futsal. Do you think the fact that you like doing jobs that are team based is correlated with your experience in the futsal world?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I definitely think that being a sports fan and especially being a sports athlete helps a lot in working with teams and being part of a team. Of course you also have people that are excellent in teams and never played anything in their lives, but I think it’s a good school. You learn that you’ll never reach your goals alone. In my team, we play five at the time, we have seven players on the bench, and sometimes at practice, we have 20. If we only had five to practice, we wouldn’t get better. It’s impossible to be in a team and look only at yourself. Sports taught me that, and also the emotional part of being in sports. Being part of a team means you have good days and bad days, but you always have to get in there, look at each other, breathe and think: <em>Okay, we will do better next time.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s impossible to be in a team and look only at yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Going back to your job, did you have any expectations and were they met?</strong></p>
<p>I can’t say I had no expectations, because if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have sent the CV in the first place. I knew it was a long shot but I had to try it, otherwise I would be always thinking, <em>If I had sent it, maybe…</em> So I just sent it and I can honestly say that I didn’t expect to be chosen. It was a ‘lucky day’, as I call it. If you would ask any of my colleagues that day, I bet no one would’ve voted for me. But now, it’s been almost three years and if you would ask them if I have the profile, I think almost 80% will say I do. That doesn’t mean I’m doing a perfect job, but I think that even the people that can say I’m not doing a wonderful job, will say that I’m not doing it because I’m new at it and it’s not easy to be in front of three big teams. I have a team of 40 people, a second team of 16 and a third team of six people. So I think that those who would say that I’m not doing a great job, would say though, that I have the ability to learn from my everyday practice and become a very good director. </p>
<p><strong>Do you think that on one hand, those who chose you, did it because you were not the typical director? A way of giving a ‘fresh air’ to the organization?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think that for the first time, that went my way. APPDA LISBOA is almost 50 years old — next March we are going to be 50 years old. And I can tell you that some of our users have been there since they were kids — our oldest user is now 60 years old.</p>
<p>APPDA LISBOA has a very important feature: it was created by families. So since the beginning, everything was done for the users, for the people with ASD, and for their families. Now we are better, but we’re not the ‘freshest’ association because we never really invested in communication, social media, or on these kinds of things that help you become popular. Our priority was always improving our internal conditions for our users. So when the last director got out of APPDA LISBOA, I think that those who had to choose the future director wanted something new: a new energy and a new approach to the position, that could maybe give a ‘lighter light’ to the association.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing classes are also part of the daily activities offered at the APPDA LISBOA" src="/jobcasts/user/pages/03.blog/a-pedagogical-director-and-a-peek-into-the-world-of-asd/drawing-classes.jpeg" /><figcaption class="text-base text-gray-600">Drawing classes are also part of the daily activities offered at the APPDA LISBOA.</figcaption></p>
<p><strong>Walk us through a typical day at work. How do you bring this ‘lighter light’ to APPDA LISBOA?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, a typical day at work — that’s hard because there are no typical days. But a semi-typical day starts at 8 a.m. [schedule during the first lockdown in Portugal], at APPDA LISBOA. Our users from the residential home — that sleep in APPDA LISBOA and don’t live with their families — start their breakfast at 8 a.m., and that’s when I get there usually. I say good morning to everyone and then I start reading emails, because at that time, there are only 30 adults with autism in the association. We still haven’t received those that live with their families, which are 30 more, nor the children — we have 2 rooms for children and teenagers, and they also only arrive after 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>At about 9.30 a.m., my door starts ringing. And then it starts: something is missing in one room, someone is not feeling so good, someone just did a great drawing, and so on. Most of the time, it’s because someone is doing something really bad or something bad happened, or because someone did something really good. I never know why someone is calling me, but usually when something happens, I know it. We try to share as much information as possible. </p>
<p>On a regular day there, all our users go to their rooms with the technicians and the therapists that work with them, and they have their own schedules with a lot of activities: they can have weaving lessons, pottery classes, music, occupational therapy, they work in our gardens, some of them help us with the laundry from the residential home, they have communication activities, they have physical education, they have psychomotor therapy, physiotherapy, etc. — so their day is pretty full with activities. Sometimes we also go to the community, to go to a museum or a park, so I have to schedule those visits. I have to try and see if something is missing, and deal with all the logistics. The whole team helps, but it’s easier for me to take care of this part because I have a computer available, and they are working directly with them which makes it more difficult to have time for more. </p>
<p>On a normal day, there are 75 people with autism in APPDA LISBOA, so it’s very common if some of them have something to tell me or that I have to take knowledge of, and this might occupy a whole day between calling the parents or checking with the doctor. And suddenly it’s 4 p.m. and I didn’t get almost any of my work done. But I think that this is also part of being a good director. I’m not the one that stays inside my office everyday and knows nothing about them. I’m the one that tries to be present and know everything that happens, so that when a family reaches me and asks for help or advice, I know already what they are talking about. I’m the one that wants to know everything and I think the team enjoys it because they know that they can rely on me. I don’t want them to see me as an unreachable person or as a boring person. Even though it’s not part of my job, I don’t mind if I have to help give lunches, or if — as sometimes happens with our students — someone had an aggressive behaviour, I don’t mind going and helping, even if it means I’m going to get hurt. And when this happens, our main goal is to protect the others and protect the person itself. So I don’t always stay at the office, I try to be in the field as much as I can.</p>
<p>But if I should describe what a pedagogical director does, this is not what it’s supposed to do. The main goal of this profession is to help develop a pedagogical program for all of the people we support. We have a team of 16 therapists that supports 151 students at schools who are integrated with other students without any disabilities. Besides this team, we have an educational team that supports 14 students that were in schools — taking part in regular classes — , but that for different reasons, no longer benefit from being in schools. Usually it’s because of their behaviour, so they are sent to specialized institutions. And then, we have the occupational activities center which works during the day, and there we have 63 adults that spend all their day there. So my job is to help each team develop specialized programs for each one of them.</p>
<p>In school, it’s a little easier because each therapist has its own group of students and they design the goals for their specific area — the psychologist is responsible for the psychology area, the speech therapist for the speech area, the psychomotor therapist for the psychomotor activities, and so on. The goal is to try and create the conditions for the student to be in school, integrated as much as possible.</p>
<p>When it comes to the educational team in our institution, the goal is a little different because those students are not in school anymore, they are only in a group with teenagers with ASD. We don’t have the inclusion part, we cannot provide that to them. So our goal here is to try and make them as independent as possible in daily life activities, such as eating, using the bathroom, being able to go to the institution and do specific tasks like helping in the garden or passing messages to people in different rooms. We try to develop very practical abilities for daily life, always thinking that they are in a family that lives in a community. What we want is that these families are able to go with their son to a supermarket, or a doctor, or a relative’s birthday party, and that he will behave and know what to expect from these experiences. So we try to regulate mostly the behavior. </p>
<p>When it gets to the adults part, that’s the hardest for me and for all of us, because when a person reaches our occupation activities center, usually it’s forever. If you are in a school, whether you’re learning how to drive, or how to cook, you have these contents and when they are over, you have a graduation diploma and you move on to the next thing. For example, in Portugal you usually get in school around six or seven years old, you study for 12 years and when you finish it, it’s over. Then you can choose to go to work or to college, but the school is programmed for those 12 years. When I think of a student with autism spectrum disorder that is 18 years old and just finished school, maybe he can’t go to work, he can’t go to college, he doesn’t speak, he can’t pursue his studies and the most adequate exit is for him to go to an occupational activities center. He is going to stay there forever, like the lady that I mentioned before that is 60 years old. So you can get in at 18 years old and leave when you are 70 or 80 years old. How do you do a pedagogical program for 50 years? That’s hard. I can tell that this year I’m going to teach you how to make a pottery plate, but I can’t teach you that for 50 years. So each year, we always have to try to see what we want to teach and the truth is we can’t expect to be teaching something new everyday, because it’s just like us. We can say, ‘In my job I learn something new everyday’, but this is a little too poetic, right? Yesterday, I learned how to do a powerpoint presentation. Today, I still know how to do it. Maybe I'll learn how to do something a little bit different, but it’s almost the same as yesterday. And probably in five years, I will still know how to do a powerpoint presentation, but I will not have learned that much since I first learned how to do it. So sometimes we feel this pressure — they have to learn, they have to evolve —, but it’s just like with us. If I work at a supermarket, I may be faster today than yesterday, but in 20 years I will not increase my speed and efficiency in the same proportion. So here, our main goal is to never stop giving the opportunity to learn — that’s one of the most important things for us. You can always learn something more. If I tell you, ‘Today he learned how to do this’, you’ll maybe say that’s not a big deal. Okay, maybe not for you, but for that person it is. So that’s the challenge: to try and always teach something or at least try that they do not lose any of their abilities. We always try to maintain or develop — this is our main goal.</p>

<p><strong>At least from what we’ve talked about until now, it looks like your job takes a big part in your life. Do you agree with that and what else is important besides work?</strong></p>
<p>This job can be overwhelming. It’s a job where you don’t turn off. You can’t say, ‘Okay, I got out at 6 p.m., so now I’m going to the gym and not think about work anymore’. I always try to save time for myself, so I can say, okay I got out at 6 p.m. and now I’m going to the gym. But when I finish my class, if I have a call from some parents, I’m going to call them back, I’m not going to wait until the next morning when I get to the institution. But in this, I have to say that all the families are very respectful and the colleagues as well. They only call if it’s something urgent. </p>
<p>I think in every job in the social area, it’s hard to close the door when you get home. I’m not going to say that I’m always thinking of my job. No, that’s not what happens, but it certainly occupies a great part of my day. As I said, I start at 8 a.m. and today, for example, I got out at around 7 p.m., that's 11 hours and I had a lunch break of less than one hour, although my daily schedule is set for 7 hours. But I do it because I like it. I’m completely against those people that work more hours because they are forced to do so, or because they feel that if they don’t do it, they will get fired. But that’s not my case. I do it because I want to and I know if some day I’ll want to do my 7 hours, I have all the right to do so. </p>
<p>So yes, work is a big part of my life, I can’t tell you otherwise. I love to practice sports, I love to do crossfit, I play indoor futsal in the national championship, I love music, I love going to live concerts, and I’m sorry that the day has only 24 hours. It’s hard for me to focus because I want to do it all, but sports are very helpful for me to release the stress and turn off my head a bit, because I’m so focused on the physical activity that I can’t even think of anything else. For my mental health, I think it helps. Everyone has their escape right? For some people, it’s music, for some it’s reading, for some it’s walking. It’s funny because at work, when I say that I’m leaving and going to do crossfit, they all say: ‘I don’t know how you can do it’. It’s hard for me to explain but that’s the best part. I don’t care if it’s going to be physically tiring, because my job is not physically tiring, it’s mostly mental work, since I always have to be available. And I have to say that the most challenging part of being in a team and somehow being the leader is to be the person that keeps it calm or loses it the least amount of times. So then, sometimes when I get home it’s when I… And especially if I don’t do crossfit. Then that might be a rough night for those that are having dinner with me. But I’m working on it. It’s not the best way, but I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you sometimes feel doubts about the job you’re doing? Do you question if you should be doing it or not?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, obviously. I have days that I get home and I go to Instagram and see those people sharing those quotes: ‘Do what you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life’, and I think, <em>Oh this is me, so perfect! I’m so happy! I’m 35 years old and I’ve never been happier</em>. And then, the next day I get home and I’m like, <em>Okay, I’m going to see if they want someone to work at the grocery store here in the neighborhood because I prefer to be here, near home and the dogs, not having to get in the car for traffic. I don’t mind if I get less money. It’s easier, I just have to deal with the groceries and that’s the perfect job for me</em>.</p>
<p>I think these are common thoughts for everyone. And then, sometimes I have those thoughts — the worst for me — that come when I left work and think I did something wrong. I start thinking that I shouldn’t have done this or that, or that maybe I don’t have the profile for this job — I thought I did, but maybe this is proving that no, after all I don't have it. But I think everyone goes through these thoughts. What’s important is to keep track of how many good days you have and if everyday you get home and think, ‘I don’t like my job’, then maybe you don’t like it. But we all have bad days and learning from our mistakes is the one advice that everyone hears, everyone gives, but not everyone follows. </p>
<p><strong>When you have these doubts, what kind of questions do you ask yourself that may help you decide what to do or at least that help you calm down?</strong></p>
<p>I think the older you get, the more tools you have to handle these bad days. And obviously not every tool works well for everyone. I have learned that when I have a bad day, the worst thing I can do is keep thinking about what I did wrong or thinking about the bad day that I just had. Sometimes the best thing to do for me is really to say to myself: <em>Okay, the day was so bad, I’m so pissed off, that I’m going to sleep. I’m going to sleep or I’m going to do crossfit and then I’m going to watch some movie or just listen to music</em>. So doing something that makes me not think of it at least for one or two hours or, if needed, a whole night, so that the next day I can look at what happened with distance. Sometimes the next day I see that it wasn’t such a big deal. I get to APPDA LISBOA and I see the house is still standing, so everything is still okay. Most of the time, I know that it wasn’t that bad. Of course other times, it was and then you’ll have to think, <em>Okay, I slept, I saw the movie, but everything is as bad as yesterday</em>. Then maybe it’s the time to face it with our heads up and see what went wrong. Sometimes it’s not our fault. There are things that happen that we can’t control. The best professional is the one that controls many things or that can make everything controllable. You have to reduce the odds of things happening without your or your team’s control, and that’s very important, but you can’t control everything. Not you, not your team — no one. So even if you do everything well, there’s always going to be something — like COVID—19. So there’s always something that will happen and prove that you have a good system, but not a perfect one and you have to deal with it.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about COVID—19, how has it been experiencing this whole situation in your job? What are the biggest problems and how have you and the whole association been dealing with them?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very hard and I’m going to put it simply this way: everyone is talking about masks, masks, masks. What if I tell you that we work with 75 people with autism in our association and probably only five of them can tolerate the masks in their faces. All the others are there the entire day without masks. It’s hard for the workers, because you have all the cautions at home with your family, or when you go to the supermarket, and then you get to your job and you have a group of five or six people with autism that don’t have a mask. You have to trust their families and try to think that they wouldn’t put them at risk, but the truth is that they don’t have a mask. It’s hard to reassure the families as well, because they know that their sons or their brothers are in a room with five or six people without a mask. And this is a health matter, so it’s hard to not be stressed.</p>
<p>It was very hard in the beginning. In March, when everything had to close, we only had our residential home users in the institution. Only around five of them went to their families’ house, because we had to close. We couldn’t receive any of our users that usually come from their home and the users from the residential home couldn't get out, because if they did, they wouldn’t be allowed to get back in. </p>
<p>So we closed in March not knowing when we could get back to normal, whatever ‘normal’ would be. And it’s hard for many of them to understand why suddenly they can’t go home for the weekend, or why their brothers are not visiting and bringing in their favourite cookies. We really thought it would be chaotic, but surprisingly most of them kind of got it. I don’t believe in paranormal stuff or whatever, but it seemed as if they sensed something was not okay. We practically didn’t have any behavioural issues during lockdown, so surprisingly they dealt with it very well. For those that went home and couldn’t come during the day, in some cases, it was harder. Their families were at home, trying to work from home, and they had to do it with their brothers, their daughters, their sons, who sometimes require a lot of attention — and that was very hard for them. We know it was worse for them at home than for us at the institution. But now we’re getting back to normal, whatever normal is. </p>
<p><strong>Did the State, in this case Portugal, give some kind of support for your type of association?</strong></p>
<p>Well first of all, residential homes for people with disabilities were equaled to the residential homes for the elderly. So having in mind that the senior groups were the risk groups, they immediately decided to close down also our residential homes, even though we don’t have anyone over 60 years old. But this I understand, because the fact that they don’t wear masks does put them at risk. So the residential home followed all the rules that got out for the elderly. </p>
<p>Then, after the lockdown, what happened was that the government started opening the schools, and there the usage of masks was essential — you could not, not use the mask. We wanted to reopen the occupational activities center for our teenagers, but then we thought we couldn’t possibly do it because none of them would tolerate the masks. Fortunately, I think the day before we had to reopen, the government released these guidelines where they said that people with disabilities, especially developmental disabilities, didn’t have to use the mask if they didn’t tolerate it — not even in public transports or in the supermarket. You just had to carry a paper where it stated that you have a disability and you can’t use the mask. So eventually they did do specific guidelines for us. Late, but they did.</p>
<p><strong>What are things that people could do to make your job easier? By people we mean your colleagues, politicians, society as a whole, etc.</strong></p>
<p>I’m gonna start with politics because it’s the easiest part. People with disabilities don’t vote and they aren’t sellable or attractive to society. We are in a place where we know they exist — and that’s not bad. Most of us know that they have the right to live — and that’s not bad either, since there were times when this was not the case. But I think we still pity them. We don’t look at them as people with abilities. And the biggest problem for ASD is that it’s hard for you to adapt your life to receive a person with autism. If I’m blind, you can give me a guidance dog or a cane, or you can put the books in braille, or give me a new smartphone with all the abilities that can help reduce the impact of me not being able to see. If I can’t hear, you have sign language, subtitles and a lot of things that you can change so that I can have access to everything, almost as you have. If I can’t walk and I’m in a wheelchair, you can put an elevator in my place, you can build some adaptations in my home, you can make my desk wider. These things cost money, they are expensive, but they are ‘easy’. I’m not saying that there are better disabilities than others, but these are easier solutions to implement. A person with ASD usually doesn’t need any of the things that cost money. The changes have to be in the way we deal with them and in the way we design the environments where they have to learn, work and live — but this is a lot of effort. So even when those in politics that have decisional power say that from now on, in all big companies, at least 5% of the employees have to be people with disabilities for example, those 5% will most likely be for someone with a physical disability, where the environments are easier to adapt. An elevator costs money, but I put it today and will never get any problem with that person. If I employ a person with autism, that might not be the case. Every day will be challenging. Not in a bad way, but even if I've had an employee with autism for the last 15 years, it’s still possible that I will face a challenge next week, because it’s part of who they are. They even surprise us, their therapists. So I think the political part is hard, because first of all, society has to start looking at them with other eyes or from another point of view. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the things that people around me can do that in some way make my job easier, I think there’s one advice that is another advice we give and hear, but don’t follow — applying empathy to everything we do. Every time I make a decision at work, I try to see the pluses, the minuses, what’s good, what’s bad, and I try to not look just at the situation itself, because there are no isolated situations. Every situation affects a worker, a person with autism, a family. So I always try to think, <em>Okay, if I choose this, what impact will it have?</em>. And at the end of the day, you’ll have to sum up all your choices and see if you’ve made the best ones. Even for the people in my team, one thing that helps is when they put themselves in my place. And fortunately, almost everyone does. It’s very common that they come to me to offer help. They only do this because they know how to be in my shoes and they show empathy. This also applies regarding our view on autism. If you put yourself in the person's shoes, or in the families’ shoes, you’ll always make better choices than if you only see yourself or the situation in a bubble that doesn’t exist. </p>
<p>Another thing that helps is to not be too impulsive. To think before we speak, that would save a lot of problems in every job.</p>

<p><strong>For people that are thinking of pursuing this area or your profession, what advice do you want to give them?</strong></p>
<p>I think you always have to work hard, and you have a lot of quotes in the sports world that talk about work, inspiration, luck, etc. The truth is you also have to be lucky. I don’t have the best resume in Lisbon for this job and I don’t have the best profile either. I happened to be at the right time, in the right place, with the right mindset. If that job vacancy had opened two months earlier, maybe I would have thought that it wasn’t for me. Or maybe if it was two months later, I might have thought, <em>No, I don’t want this, I want to change my professional area</em>. So it really came in the perfect moment and for that, I think you have to be lucky. I know a lot of people that work harder than me, that have studied way more than me, but didn’t get the opportunities I got. And sometimes it’s the small choices you do. Whether you apply to that job interview or to the other, or whether you choose a place that’s near your home or that is far. Every choice we make contributes to the butterfly effect. You can make small choices that will affect everything around you. What helps me not regret what I do is when I choose something, if I look at it like three months later, I never think, <em>Oh, I was so stupid, I should have chosen something else</em>. No, because at that time, with the information I had, I chose what I thought was right and I couldn’t predict what came later.</p>
<p>I really think that you have to be lucky and brave — be bold to take risks. Especially if you want to go up in a company or in a job, you have to take risks because if you only do what you’re paid for, it’s going to be hard for someone to notice you.</p>
<p>Another thing I think helped me get this job and have some success in it, was to be in the field for 10 years, suffering what a regular worker suffers — thinking I’m not paid enough to do this, I’m not getting the conditions I should have, or thinking, oh wait, these people need to be viewed with other eyes, these families, in schools, in the community... Being in the field was the most important thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I really think that you have to be lucky and brave — be bold to take risks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I studied for four years — which was the basic course — and didn’t get a masters or am thinking of getting one, but only because I’m very immersed in my job, so I can’t even think of having something else on my mind. Of course I could say I’m going to stop playing futsal or crossfit for a few months and study, but I know that for my mental health, that wouldn’t be good — and automatically for my daily job, that wouldn’t be good either because I can get really grumpy. I know there are some jobs where they really value your CV, your masters or your PHD’s, but as I said, I was lucky. I was lucky that at that time, those who were choosing were more concerned with having a ‘new light’ or a new approach to the job, than with having someone with a very good CV. If it was for the CV, I wouldn’t have gotten the job, I know. Or at least, for the study part, because for the professional part, as I always worked with autism, I was aware of what the concerns were and what the reality of these families is. But the studies for me weren’t decisive, that I can tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else you think is important to share about your profession?</strong></p>
<p>Let me just add this: everyone can make a difference — in their house, in their neighborhood, in their city — , so we should never look away when we see an opportunity to do something good. Most of us will have contact with someone with autism. It might be the colleague in your school that doesn’t say a word and has some aggressive behavior. You think he is very strange and you sometimes are very scared of him. It can also be an engineer that can be brilliant at maths, but can’t even say ‘hi’ when he walks into a room, because the social part is completely ‘inadequate’. Autism is really a spectrum and sometimes we tend to see Hollywood movies and think, <em>Oh so this is what autism means! They go to a corner and they start banging their heads and flapping their hands and they are very good at memorizing train stations! That’s what an autistic person is</em>. This is not the reality. So if you’re interested, try to search different cases of autism, try to know them, their families, their challenges, and try to put yourself in their shoes. Or if it’s difficult to put yourself in their shoes because we don’t know what it’s like to be an autist, try to put yourself in their families’ shoes, because it’s not easy for a family to have a lifetime with a person with autism that doesn’t ‘fit’ in our society. And if someone wants to know more about autism or about our work, you can always send me an email and I will be more than happy to give you a tour through our institution. We always have our doors open. We’ve had groups from South Korea, Finland, the US, etc. — and it’s a very good moment when we get to share our work and listen to people that come from the other side of the globe and end the tour and the meetings with a smile, saying we do a great job. And then we start to think that we’re here in small Portugal, without a lot of support, without many resources, and we have the Americans and the Koreans saying that we do a great job and that they will bring our methods to their institutions — and well, we get proud!</p>
